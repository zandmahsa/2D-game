# The_leftovers
We created a 2D game called "The Leftovers" using the Unity game engine. 

Upon launching the game, a menu will appear with instructions available in the help section.

Playing the game is easy. Use the arrow keys to move left or right and the spacebar to jump. 

Use the left mouse button to shoot bubbles that will destroy the giants. 

There is no limit to the number of bubbles that can be shot, but it takes two shots to destroy a giant. 

Pay attention to warning signs in the game that signal the presence of zombies, giants, and other dangers.

In the game, you must collect coins to progress. 

Gold chests grant ten coins each. 

If you encounter zombies, you will return to the start of the game.

You'll also lose hearts if you hit spikes, but there are hearts to collect to replenish them. 

At the start of the game, you have three hearts, but more can be found throughout the game.

We downloaded the sprites used in this game from the https://craftpix.net/ website 

Buildings in the game can teleport you ahead, but be careful not to turn back upon entering one. 

Falling from the ground tiles will result in a game over.

Although there is only one level, the game is exciting and challenging enough to keep you entertained. Don't be fooled by its apparent simplicity!
